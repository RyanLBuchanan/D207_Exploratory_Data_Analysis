    "Most relevant to our decision making process is the dependent variable of \"Churn\" which is binary categorical with only two values, \"Yes\" or \"No\".  In cleaning the data, we discovered relevance of the continuous numerical data columns \"Tenure\" (the number of months the customer has stayed with the provider), \"MonthlyCharge\" (the average monthly charge to the customer) & \"Bandwidth_GB_Year\" (the average yearly amount of data used, in GB, per customer).  Finally, the discrete numerical data from the survey responses from customers regarding various customer service features is relevant in the decision-making process.  In the surveys, customers provided ordinal numerical data by rating 8 customer service factors (\"timely response\", \"timely fixes\", \"timely replacements\", \"reliability\", \"options\", \"respectful response\", \"courteous exchange\" & \"evidence of active listening\") on a scale of 1 to 8 (1 = most important, 8 = least important)."
