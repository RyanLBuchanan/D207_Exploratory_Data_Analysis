Also, I find the Jupyter notebooks a convenient way to run code visually, in its attractive single document markdown format, the ability to display results of code and graphic visualizations and provide crystal-clear running documentation for future reference.   A thorough installation and importation of Python packages and libraries will provide specially designed code to perfom complex data science tasks rather than personally building them from scratch.
